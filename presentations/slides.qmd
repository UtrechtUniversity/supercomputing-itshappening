# (Super)computing @ ITS{data-background-color="#FFCD00"}

## What is supercomputing?

<br>
<br>

::: {.theme-section}
> High Performance Computing, known as supercomputing, is really nothing less than the ability to process complex (computational) tasks at very high speed. The machine you use to do this is called a Supercomputer. (EuroCC Netherlands)

## What is supercomputing?

::: {.theme-section}
Todays biggest supercomputers have:

- (hundreds of) thousands of CPU cores
- thousands of GPUs
- petabytes of storage
- fast interconnect (e.g. 200 Gbit/s)

~10^18 floating point operations per second (Exascale)

## How do we organize access?

![](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/re-surf-research-day-2024/blob/main/presentations/images/website.png?raw=true){width=75%}

- Intake with Research engineer (30 minutes)
- Trial budget
- &rarr; Onboarding time ~2 days

## HPC support at ITS

::: {.theme-section}
Making sure UU researchers have low barrier access to computing resources

- Trial budgets
- Consultancy
- Grant applications
- VRE development
- Training
- Support

## Summarizing

::: {.theme-section}

- Supercomputing enables 
  - tackling complex problems
  - large-scale data analysis
  - accelerating scientific discovery

- Increasing need for VREs, training and support
  - New disciplines, long tail
  - Adoption of AI
  - Consortia
  - Sensitive data

:::

## Future Directions

::: {.theme-section}
